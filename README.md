# `crystal`

## Why?

There are plenty of high-level graphics libraries that allow you to easily draw
shapes to the screen. There are also well know low-level libraries that allow
you to manage the GPU to a very fine grained level.

`crystal` tries to be neither of those.

`crystal` would be best described as a mid-level graphics library. I don't want
to have to manage every minute detail of the GPU, I just want to pass my vertex
data into a shader to render to the screen.
